                    When Will My Phone Get Android 12 Update?

                    Android 12’s first beta is officially here and you can install it right now on supported phones.
                    While
                    not everyone might be having a compatible phone to get an early taste of Android 12, we have
                    compiled a
                    complete list of phones that will get the Android 12 update after it gets a stable release later
                    this
                    year.

                    Redmi Note 10S Launched in India with Helio G95, Price Starting at ₹14,999
                </h1>
                <p class=" text-xl text-center overflow-auto ">
                    The Redmi Note 10S is very much a Redmi Note 10 as far as the design language is concerned,
                    especially with regards to the camera module. The phone comes with a 6.43-inch SuperAMOLED panel
                    with a resolution of 2400×1080 as well as support for the DCI-P3 color gamut, 1100 nits of peak
                    brightness, and 180Hz touch sampling rate — all of which sounds pretty good.
